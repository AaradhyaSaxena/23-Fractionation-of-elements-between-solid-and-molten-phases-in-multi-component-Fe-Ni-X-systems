1.Here we aim to refurnish the inventory of the existing data sets with new ones and develop new parameterisation expressions for multi- element(non-metals) system i.e. Fe-Ni-S-P-C-Si system.
The previous parameterisation by Chabot and Jones (2003) was obtained for 12 siderophile elements while here a total of 29 elements ( both Siderophile and non-siderophile elements) have been taken into consideration and new updated D0 and Beta values are to be calculated from the new model fit to the experimental data.
2.In previous parameterisation the effect of presence of Silicon as an non-metal in then crystallising liquid has not been considered.
Hence I have tried to modify the parameterisation expression by Chabot and Jones (2003) by inculcating an additional term for Si and revising the values.
3. Also the previous parametrisation of the Partition coefficients for the Siderophile elements by Malvin and Jones (1990) as well as Chabot and Jones (2003) has been obtained as a function of the Fe domains in the liquid metal.
Here I have tried fitting the same experimental data by calculating the fraction of Fe-S domains (Chabot 2003) and plotting the partition coefficients as a function of Fe-S domains for the Fe-Ni-S Systems.
Thus, if the composition of the metallic liquid is known, a segregation coefficient of a trace constituent may be predicted- even if the temperature, exact Fe/Ni ratio, and information about the activity coefficient in the solid phase are unknown.
