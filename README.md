# Fractionation of elements between solid and molten phases in multi component Fe-Ni-X systems
1.Here we aim to refurnish the inventory of the existing data sets with new ones and develop new parameterisation expressions for multi- element(non-metals) system i.e. Fe-Ni-S-P-C-Si system.
The previous equation by Chabot and Jones (2003), assumes the effect of Fe/Ni ratio on the fractionation of elements, we are also testing those assumptions.
2.In previous equation the effect of qualitative varibles has not been considered. Hence I have tried to modify the model by Chabot and Jones (2003) by inculcating the effect of various systems.
