In this problem we are given D(Cu) and FeDomains, and our job is to find a relation between these two for different elements.
The relation between these two will vary depending upon the nature of elements.
We have an initial model, which is derived from equations of thermodynamics, but still we will first try to come up with an equation, on the basis of data collected.
